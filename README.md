# Signal38
Back in 2005, 37signals had the cleanest, clearest agency site around. This theme is an ode to that look and feel, and an attempt at internalizing the clarity with which it was designed and built.

The code in this theme is intended to be as clean and calm as possible, to echo the aesthetic of the site itself.

This is in no way an original work, it simply stands in homage to the design work of Scott Upton, Jason Fried, Matt Lindemeyer and Ryan Singer.
